# MIOS Architecture Principles

**Binding. These outrank convenience, and they outrank "helpful" refactors.**

The one that governs the rest:

> **MIOS V5 is the computation layer. MIOS V6 is the intelligence layer.**
> V6 must never become a second analytics engine. It interprets, correlates and
> explains the canonical outputs V5 produces — it never recomputes them.

The failure this prevents is not waste. It is **two implementations of the same
market logic disagreeing**, in a system that still looks coherent from outside.

## 1 · Single source of truth

Every market fact has exactly one owner.

| Fact | Owner |
|---|---|
| Buy/sell split, CVD, CBV, CSV | `indicators/order_flow.py` |
| Money Flow Profile | `indicators/money_flow_profile.py::calculate_money_flow_profile` |
| Candle Delta Volume | `indicators/volume_delta.py::calculate_volume_delta` |
| VPFR | `vob_minimal.py::compute_vpfr` |
| VOB | `vob_minimal.py::analyze_vob_volume` |

`mios_v5/order_flow_snapshot.py::OWNERS` is the machine-readable version.
No stage may recreate any of these.

## 2 · Never recalculate existing data

If V5 computes it, V6 consumes it. These must never exist:

```
calculate_cvd_v6()   money_flow_v6()   vpfr_v6()   vob_v6()
```

Enforced by `test_no_duplicate_order_flow_engine_exists`
(`mios_v5/tests/test_order_flow.py`), which fails the build on any
`def <indicator>_v6(`.

## 3 · One calculation → many consumers

```
Calculation → published once → shared object → unlimited consumers
```

Never four parallel calculations. If two places need the same number, one of
them publishes and the other reads.

## 4 · No hidden logic

An engine that needs Money Flow, CVD, VPFR, Volume or VOB **receives them as
parameters**.

```python
Stage43.run(order_flow_snapshot)        # good
Stage43.run()                            # bad — reaches into session_state
```

Hidden inputs cannot be tested, replayed, or explained. An engine whose inputs
are invisible will eventually be wrong in a way nobody can reconstruct.

## 5 · Engines never own indicators

Indicators describe markets. Engines interpret indicators.

```
Indicator → Engine        ✅
Engine → Indicator        ❌
```

## 6 · Preserve the observational rule

No refactor may change Entry, Guardian, Decision, Alerts or Confidence.
**Only duplication is removed. Behaviour stays identical.**

Prove it, don't assert it: transcribe the original formula, run both against the
same input, assert equality. See `test_the_primitive_reproduces_every_original_site`.

## 7 · Backward compatibility

Every dashboard, Telegram message, API and alert keeps working. Internal
architecture may change; the outside may not notice.

## 8 · Publish everything once

One `OrderFlowSnapshot` carrying Money Flow · CVD · CSV · CBV · Delta ·
Buy Volume · Sell Volume · Volume · VPFR · VOB. Engines read only this object.

## 9 · Fail fast — never invent market data

An unmeasured fact is `MISSING`, never `0`.

Zero is a **market fact** — perfectly balanced flow. Asserting one that was
never observed is fabricating data, and the consumer cannot tell the difference.
`MISSING` is falsy and never equal to `0`, so a caller that forgets to check
gets a sentinel rather than a plausible lie.

```python
from indicators.order_flow import MISSING, is_missing
assert MISSING != 0      # the whole point
assert not MISSING       # falsy, so `if not x:` still guards
```

## 10 · Performance

A refactor must **reduce** calculations, session lookups, duplicated formulas
and CPU. Never increase them. Measure before and after.

## 11 · Deliver the audit

Every consolidation ships with a before/after count. See
`docs/AUDIT_ORDER_FLOW_V5.md` and the refactor audit in the PR body.

## 12 · Non-negotiable

Restated because it is the one that decays quietest:

> V5 computes. V6 interprets. A year from now there must still be exactly one
> implementation of every piece of market logic in this system.

## Honest limits of the enforcement

The guard tests catch the *named* failure modes — a `*_v6()` function, an
`import requests` inside `mios_v5`, a reserved word in a migration. They cannot
catch someone reimplementing CVD inline under a different variable name inside a
render block. That is exactly how the six copies arose in the first place.

The durable defence is principle 3: if a number is worth computing, publish it,
and the next person will find it rather than rewrite it.
