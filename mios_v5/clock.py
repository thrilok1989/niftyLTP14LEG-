"""MIOS — one clock, and it is IST.

NSE trades in IST. Every date this system reasons about — the trading day, the
session's opening range, "today's" candles, when a signal was born — is an IST
concept. Anything computed in another zone is wrong in a way that is invisible
until it isn't.

## Where it actually bit

**`datetime.fromtimestamp(x)` with no tzinfo returns the *container's* local
time.** This app runs on servers set to UTC, so every timestamp rendered that
way was 5½ hours early: a beat logged at 14:05 IST displayed as 08:35, and a
replay frame at 10:42 read as 05:12. The values were right; the rendering was
silently wrong.

**Slicing an ISO string to get the time** (`s[11:16]`) reads whatever offset the
string carries. A row written with `+00:00` renders as UTC and a row written
with `+05:30` renders as IST — from the same table, in the same list.

**A trading day derived in UTC rolls over at 05:30 IST**, splitting a single
session across two dates. Every per-day join — day-type performance, daily
summary, engine attribution — would silently mis-bucket the morning.

## What this does and does not fix in Supabase

`TIMESTAMPTZ` stores an absolute instant. Writing `+05:30` instead of `+00:00`
for the same moment does **not** change what is stored — it is the same point in
time either way. What changes is what a human sees in the Supabase table editor,
in a CSV export, and in any raw JSON: IST, which is the only zone this desk
thinks in. The genuine correctness fixes are the *derived* values above — dates,
session slices and rendered times — not the instants.

Pure module. No IO.
