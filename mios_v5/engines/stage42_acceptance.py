"""Stage 42 — Acceptance / Rejection / Trap ⭐ (the timing engine).

The Bias Engine says where the market is likely to go. **This one says when the
probability has shifted enough to actually take the trade** — by watching what
happens after price reaches an institutional level.

It calculates nothing of its own. S/R comes from the Reaction-Zone object, flow
from Order Flow, dealer direction from the Dealer engine, OI change from Options.
Stage 42 only answers: *after price reached that level, who actually won?*

Outputs one reaction state per side (support & resistance) plus the ACTIVE one —
the level price is currently contesting — with a confidence and, when the battle
has resolved, the implied action (ENTER CALL / ENTER PUT).

Non-negotiable: a FAILED break is not tradable until the flow that drove it has
demonstrably reversed. Failed ≠ trap. The trap is the confirmation.

v0 is OBSERVATIONAL — it publishes and logs; the Decision Engine reads it as
evidence, and it is promoted to a hard trigger only once the logs justify it.
