"""MIOS V6 — the Order Flow Family.

Money Flow, Candle Delta, CVD, CSV, CBV, Volume and VOB are **not** seven
indicators. They are seven views of one thing: who is transacting, and with how
much urgency. Letting them vote separately counts the same order flow up to
seven times, which is how a single tape ends up outvoting the dealer book.

So they collapse here, once, into a single family result:

    direction · strength · reliability · confidence

and only that result is allowed into Stage 53.

## This module calculates NOTHING

Every input is a value V5 already computed. There is no `money_flow_v6()`, no
`cvd_v6()`, no `delta_v6()` — deliberately, and `test_no_duplicate_order_flow_
engine_exists` fails the build if one appears. V5 is the calculation layer; V6
reads it, correlates it, and explains it. A second implementation of CVD would
not just be waste, it would be a second *answer*, and the two would drift.

## Volume does not vote

Volume has no direction. A big bar is not bullish; it is *loud*. Making volume
a directional member would be casting a ballot on magnitude. It feeds
reliability instead — the same for a volume spike whichever way price went.

## Reliability is not agreement

Because these members are correlated by construction, six of them agreeing is
much weaker evidence than six independent families agreeing. Reliability
therefore reflects **coverage** (how many members actually reported) as well as
coherence, and is capped so a family speaking from two members can never claim
the confidence of one speaking from seven.

Pure module: dicts in, dict out. No pandas, no session, no IO.
