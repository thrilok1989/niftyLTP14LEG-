"""MIOS V6 — the dashboard palette.

A trading screen is read in a lit room, at a glance, under time pressure. The
original palette leaned on GitHub-dark greys (`#8fa1b3`, `#5d6b7d`) for labels,
engine attributions and every explanatory line — which is most of the words on
the screen. On a `#0d1117` card those sit around 4:1 contrast, fine for prose
and wrong for a panel a trader has to scan in two seconds.

Every muted tone was lifted one band. Nothing structural changed: the accent
colours (bull green, bear red, warning amber) are untouched, so the *meaning*
of a colour is exactly what it was — only the greys got brighter.

    INK        #ffffff   headline values, the number you came for
    BRIGHT     #edf3f9   primary text
    BODY       #dfe7f0   explanatory sentences
    MUTED      #cfd9e6   labels, secondary detail
    LABEL      #c4d0de   inline sub-labels
    MICRO      #b3c2d4   uppercase micro-labels
    ATTRIB     #9fb0c4   engine attributions ("Stage 42 Acceptance")
    FAINT      #93a5ba   the dimmest thing allowed on screen

Semantic accents, unchanged:

    BULL       #00ff88   BULL_SOFT  #17c98b
    BEAR       #ff4444   BEAR_SOFT  #ff6666
    WARN       #ffd000   ALERT      #ff9500   DANGER  #ff2d55
    INFO       #4da6ff   VIOLET     #a78bfa   MINT    #7fe8b0

Surfaces:

    CARD_BG    #0d1117   CARD_BORDER #1e2836
    PANEL_BG   #0f1622   GRID        #161b22

Panels still write hex inline — retrofitting every f-string to constants would
be a large diff for no behavioural gain. This module is the reference: new
panels should use these names, and anything dimmer than `FAINT` does not belong
on a screen someone trades from.
